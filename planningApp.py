# You are designing an app for your festival to help attendees have the best experience possible! As part of the application, users will be able to easily search their favorite artist and find out the day, time, and stage the artist is playing at. Write a function get_artist_info() that accepts a string artist and a dictionary festival_schedule mapping artist's names to dictionaries containing the day, time, and stage they are playing on. Return the dictionary containing the information about the given artist.

# If the artist searched for does not exist in festival_schedule, return the dictionary {"message": "Artist not found"}.
